Build a script and the necessary infrastructure for running it, in order to backup a MongoDB[0] database containing some data. The database will be simulated using a Docker[1] container. 

Suggested steps:

1. Configure and run the MongoDB database in a Docker container
2. Add some randomly generated data to the database
3. Build a script in your favorite programing language which runs on your local machine(or docker), that gets data from the database(database name is specified as a script argument), compresses it and saves it on the local disk.
4. Bonus part: restore the data back in MongoDB, in a different database, using either a command or a script(it can be the same script with multiple functionalities) 

What we want from you: A step by step guide instructing us how to do your assignment from start to finish!

Example of guide: 

1. Pull the mongo docker image xxx
2. Start the mongo container with the command: <command>.
.
.
K. Populate mongo data like this # bonus points if done using a script as well
.
.
N. Run the script like this
N+1 Data is backed up on disk.

We will then follow your guide step by step and we should see the expected result: The mongo data is backed up on the local disk. Make sure to include the script and any other needed resources in a publicly accessible place(github, attachment to email, google docs, whatever).
